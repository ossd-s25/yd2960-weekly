# On the topic of open source
Open source is a almost a software exclusive term that is celebrated by most developers. As far as I am concerned, its benefits far outweigh its drawbacks. We are benefit from open source software even when we are unaware of it. The greatest perk of open source software is that it is free. Moreover, it is far less likely that open source software can be rigged since every modification can be easily tracked. Open source software avoids reinventing the wheels and can standardize the industry. Companies can benefit from developing open source software by attracting users, convincing stakeholders, and increasing marketshare.

## Open source software that I know or regularly use
**VSCode**, the software I am using to edit the post, is an open source software by Microsoft. VSCode is argubally the best text editor on the market - it is free, lightweight, expandabale (plugins), and funded by a tech giant. **Chromium** is the core of most modern browsers. On GitHub, Chromium received more than a million commits. It is constantly updated, and the latest commit by the time I checked is only 1 hour ago. **Mindustry** is a cool open source game. Despite the fact that it is open source on GitHub, one still has to pay for the game on Steam. **Linux** is the standard OS in the industry. It is favored because of its performance and transparency as an open source project.
