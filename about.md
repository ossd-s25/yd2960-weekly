My name is Johnny Ding, or Yuqing Ding, or 丁誉清. I was born and raised in Shanghai, China. I transferred from Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology because of countryside depression (not officially diagnosed). My special ability is to know none of my classmate's name before the semester ends. Nevertheless, I am more than capable of engaging in teamwork, especially when it is required.
